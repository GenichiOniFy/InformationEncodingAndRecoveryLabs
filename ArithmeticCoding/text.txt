I remember a wonderful moment.:
You appeared before me.,
Like a fleeting vision,
Like a genius of pure beauty.

In the languor of hopeless sadness,
In the anxieties of a noisy fuss,
I heard a gentle voice for a long time
And dreamed of cute features.

The years passed. Storms are a rebellious gust
Dispelled the old dreams,
And I forgot your gentle voice,
Your heavenly features.

In the wilderness, in the darkness of imprisonment
My days passed quietly
Without divinity, without inspiration,
Without tears, without life, without love.

The soul has awakened:
And here you are again,
Like a fleeting vision,
Like a genius of pure beauty.

And my heart is beating in ecstasy,
And for him they were resurrected again.
Both divinity and inspiration,
And life, and tears, and love.
